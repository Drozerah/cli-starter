> A Command Line Interface starter boilerplate

## Install

````bash
# GET the latest version
$ git clone https://github.com/Drozerah/cli-starter.git

# Rapid install
$ git clone https://github.com/Drozerah/cli-starter.git my-project-name && cd my-project-name && npm install && code . && exit
````
Then install globally: 
````bash
$ npm install -g
````
Once you are done with this step, you need to:

````bash
$ npm link
````
This command will register your CLI project locally so you are now able to run the command below anywhere into the terminal:

````bash
$ cli-starter
````
This command will prompt a message into the terminal meaning that everything is fine with the installation of _cli-starter_ module:

![cli starter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drozerah/MyGitHubStorage/master/gif/cli-starter/cli-starter.gif)

__CLI command name:__

Because all projects are differents, you'll certainly need to change the name of the command that runs your own CLI:

`package.json`
```diff
{
//...
    "bin": {
-       "cli-starter": "bin/cli.js"
+       "myCommand": "bin/cli.js"
    }
//...
}
```

__Development:__ 

````bash
$ npm run dev
````
This command will execute the `cli-starter\bin\cli.js` JavaScript file, it can also be used during the development phase of your project...

__Notes:__

In order to prevent accidental publication of you project, the `"private"` key is set to `true` by default - to publish your project to the NPM registry you must turn the value to `false`

`package.json`
```diff
{
//...
-    "private": true
+    "private": false
//...
}
```

`npm command`

If you want or have to unregister your project, you'll need to unbind the symlink created from your project's directory to your global node modules, keep in mind to:
````bash
$ npm unlink
````
This command will also disable the `cli-starter` command into the terminal.
